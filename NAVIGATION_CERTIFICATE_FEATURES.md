## üéØ New Features Added

Based on your requirements, I've implemented two major enhancements:

**Feature**: Added ability to go back to previous steps during instruction screens

**Implementation**:

### 2. Custom Certificate Generation with User Input üìú
**Feature**: Personalized certificate generation with student information prompts

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Navigation Enhancement
```javascript

</button>

// Smart visibility logic
if (stepIndex === 0) {
    prevBtn.style.display = 'none';
} else {
    prevBtn.style.display = 'inline-flex';
}

// Navigation handler
currentStep = Math.max(currentStep - 1, 0);
```
